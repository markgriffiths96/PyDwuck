====================== Readme - Angular Distrubution Analysis ======================

== Folders and files ==

- Channel 1400+ analysis: Analysis of angular distribution of peaks with channel number higher than 1400 in the Re190 spectrum
	
	- Old Versions: Contains old spectra files with incorrect treatment of the spin of the beams along with analysis and data storage files
	- Current versions: Same as the above, but spin of the beams has been treated correctly
	
- Fitting Programs: Programs for fitting the angular spectra

	- Old versions: Contains old spectra and fitting files with incorrect treatment of the spin of the beams
	- Current versions: Contains up and down spectra for each angle the Q3D was placed at, with analysis files
